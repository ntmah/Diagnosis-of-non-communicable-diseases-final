# AI-BASED NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM

## Overview
This project implements a neural network built from scratch for multi-class
classification of three non-communicable diseases based on structured medical indicators.

Four optimization algorithms (GD, SGD, Mini-Batch GD, Adam) were implemented
to compare convergence behavior and predictive performance.

The system is deployed as a web application that integrates:
- OCR for extracting medical parameters from health forms
- A prediction API
- A chatbot interface powered by Gemini API
## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React / HTML CSS 
* **Backend:** FastAPI / Python
* **AI/ML:** OCR and Chatbot Systems Using Gemini API, Custom Neural Network (from scratch)
* **Database:** MongoDB
